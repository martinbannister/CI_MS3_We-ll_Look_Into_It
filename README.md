## User Experience

The site is to be designed with simplicity and ease of access in mind.  It will have a mobile first approach to make reporting potholes quick and easy.  Users will be required to register for an account to report and manage their pothole submissions.  Users will be given the opportunity to comment on their submissions to provide helpful information as to why the pothole should be dealt with.  Search capability will be provided so users, registered or not, can check if a pothole has been reported already to save duplicate reports.

### Target Audience

* Public road users
* Council employees responsible for road maintenance

## Scope

The following features will be included based on the goals and user stories.

1. Limited user management with the ability to register for a new account.
2. Create new pothole reports.
3. Search existing pothole reports.
4. Edit your own pothole reports.
5. Delete your own reports.
6. See the status of reports.

Admin features:

7. Add and remove Areas from counties.
8. Grant other users admin privileges.

Master Admin account features:

9. Add, Edit and Delete counties.
10. Add, Edit and Delete Pothole status'.
11. Revoke user admin privileges.

### Colour Scheme

### Typography

### Images

The only image used on the site is the logo that I created.  It was inspired by style of the images in [this](https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/stick-figure-man-and-a-hole-on-the-floor-gm1272335094-374636205) istock image.  I created it using Google Drawings which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/17fdpqD9YCwc9MGaTk4Du6HQFjLJsyXwJ5eOzAeuh3TQ/edit?usp=sharing).
