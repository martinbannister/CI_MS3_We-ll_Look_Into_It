## User Experience

The site is to be designed with simplicity and ease of access in mind.  It will have a mobile first approach to make reporting potholes quick and easy.  Users will be required to register for an account to report and manage their pothole submissions.  Users will be given the opportunity to comment on their submissions to provide helpful information as to why the pothole should be dealt with.  Search capability will be provided so users, registered or not, can check if a pothole has been reported already to save duplicate reports.

### Target Audience

* Public road users
* Council employees responsible for road maintenance

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitors

As a first time visitor I want...

1. to be able to search pothole reports to see if a report has already been made.
2. to easily register for the site and submit a pothole report.

#### Returning Visitors

Upon returning to the site I want to...

3. view a list of my reports and check their status.
4. update my reports to add or remove information.
5. upvote other users reports.
6. request a previously unrepaired pothole be reviewed following a change to it's condition.

#### Council Employees

As someone administering potholes for a coucil I want to...

7. view a list of all pothole reports for my county.
8. see any newly submitted pothole reports.
9. update the status of existing reports and add comments.
10. grant access to my colleagues to be able to update reports.
11. add or update Areas for my county.
12. add or update Pothole Status'.

## Scope

Based on the project goals the site will use the templating language flask so content can be built dynamically based on a backend database.  For this project MongoDB will be used for the data because of the simple data structure.

The following features will be included based on the goals and user stories.

1. Limited user management with the ability to register for a new account.
2. Create new pothole reports.
3. Search existing pothole reports.
4. Edit your own pothole reports.
5. Delete your own reports.
6. See the status of reports.

Admin features:

7. Add and remove Areas from counties.
8. Grant other users admin privileges.

Master Admin account features:

9. Add, Edit and Delete counties.
10. Add, Edit and Delete Pothole status'.
11. Revoke user admin privileges.

## Design

Used Materialize

### Database

The author designed the database schema to allow fo flexibility of use to be adaptable to a wide range of councils.

### Colour Scheme

### Typography

### Images

The only image used on the site is the logo that I created.  It was inspired by style of the images in [this](https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/stick-figure-man-and-a-hole-on-the-floor-gm1272335094-374636205) istock image.  I created it using Google Drawings which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/17fdpqD9YCwc9MGaTk4Du6HQFjLJsyXwJ5eOzAeuh3TQ/edit?usp=sharing).

### Features

### Technologies Used

### Testing

Testing has been documented in the separate [TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) file

### Deployment

### Heroku
I have used Heroku to deploy this site.  If you would like to do the same follow these steps.
1. Within your project directory create a _.gitignore_ file & an _env.py_ file
2. Open _env.py_ and enter `import os`
3. Then set the following environment variables: 
```
os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "your unique secret key")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "your unique mongo db link")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "your database name")
```
3. Add _env.py_ to the _.gitignore_ file so this senstive information is not pushed to Github
4. In a bash terminal type `pip3 freeze __local > requirements.txt`
5. Type `echo web: python app.py > Procfile` (note the capital P of Procfile)
6. Open the Procfile and remove any blank line from the bottom
7. `git add` then `git push` these files to your repository
8. Visit [heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/) and sign in or sign up
9. Click the _New_ button > _Create new app_ in the top right
0. Enter a unique app name, this is unique to all of Heroku, not just your account
0. Select the region closest to you
0. Click _Create app_
0. Make sure you're on the Deploy tab and select GitHub from Deployment Method
0. Check that your GitHub account name is showing
0. Type part of the name of your repo to search and click _Search_
0. Click connect for the repo oyu want to connect
0. Select the Settings tab
0. Click _Reveal config vars_
0. Enter the config vars as set in your _env.py_ file above
0. Ensure that your _Procfile_ and _requirements.txt_ files are committed and pushed to GitHub
0. Return to the Deploy tab
0. Enable automatic deployments
0. Select the branch (usually main) and click Deploy Branch
0. Once the app been deployed, click on the _Open app_ tab at the top right of the page.
