## User Experience

The site is to be designed with simplicity and ease of access in mind.  It will have a mobile first approach to make reporting potholes quick and easy.  Users will be required to register for an account to report and manage their pothole submissions.  Users will be given the opportunity to comment on their submissions to provide helpful information as to why the pothole should be dealt with.  Search capability will be provided so users, registered or not, can check if a pothole has been reported already to save duplicate reports.

### Target Audience

* Public road users
* Council employees responsible for road maintenance
